/**Basic Theory
 * AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
 * is a set of "web development techniques" using many web technologies on the "client-side"
 * to create asynchronous web applications.
 * With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asychronously (in the background)
 * without interfering with the display and behavior of exisiting page
 */

// We don't use data in XML format anymore
// We use JSON now 


//we have three common ways to create and send request to the server
// 1. XmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2. fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3. axios (this is third party library)
